# My Personal Portfolio Website

This is a single-page experience designed to showcase my skills as a full-stack web developer. This project was built using React/Vite as a front-end experience with integrated back-end support using Supabase.

## Key features

```
- Single-page experience using routes to navigate.
- Mobile responsive, including a navigation that swaps to a hamburger menu.
- Admin sign-in using a magic link to verified email, allowing for elevated site access.
- Features and Blog pages sync'd to a Supabase backend. Admin access allows the user to post, edit, and delete blogs and features.
- Dark mode.
```
