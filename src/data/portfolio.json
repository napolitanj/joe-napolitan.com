    "title": "Ski Mount Sneffels: Snake Couloir Guide",
    "description": "This in-depth route guide documents my self-planned ascent and ski descent of the Snake Couloir on Mount Sneffels — a 14,157-foot peak in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado. I researched, scouted, climbed, and skied the line over a 14-hour day, then built a resource from scratch to help others do the same. The page includes route beta, gear recommendations, GPS maps, and photography from the trip. It now ranks as a go-to reference for ski mountaineers, drawing over 1,000 visits in some seasons.",
