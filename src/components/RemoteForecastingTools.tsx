                    <p>
                      Snow cover is a key consideration when planning a winter
                      backpacking trip or a high-elevation hike in late spring
                      or early summer. Correct assessments can mean the
                      difference between a well-planned adventure and one that
                      wastes time, money, and energy. Fortunately, several free
                      digital resources can help you make informed decisions
                      when planning routes involving snow travel.

                      Understanding the basics of mountain snowpacks and how to
                      assess terrain remotely is crucial for extending your
                      backpacking season. This article provides tips and tools
                      for effective trip planning whenever snow is a factor,
                      whether you're setting off tomorrow or in the coming
                      months.

                          <p>
                            Three distinct snow climates exist in mountainous
                            regions:

                              <p>
                                <strong>Maritime snowpacks</strong> exist closer
                                to oceans and experience heavier snowfall with
                                comparatively warmer temperatures. These regions
                                see storms that drop immense amounts of
                                high-density snow with warm temperatures,
                                leading to thick, consolidated snowpacks.
                              </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              <p>
                                <strong>Continental snowpacks</strong> are found
                                in regions further from the ocean at high
                                elevations and tend to see less precipitation
                                than maritime climates. Storms in these regions
                                are cold and tend to drop snow in lower volumes
                                at lighter densities. Due to the characteristics
                                of these storms, the resulting snowpack in these
                                regions commonly presents layers of snow that
                                vary in density and quality.

                                two climates.

                            generalized assessments and that anomalies exist.
                            During winters when more or less snow may fall than
                            usual in any given area, mountains in a continental
                            climate may present conditions found in a maritime
                            environment and vice versa.

                            Snowpacks will evolve when exposed to gravity,
                            changes in temperature, and insulation from
                            continued snowfall. A temperature delta, referred to
                            as a <strong>temperature gradient</strong>, exists
                            where a snowpack consolidates and evolves toward
                            consistent density.

                              temperature over at least 1 Â°C over a depth of
                              10cm, the snowpack will consolidate and round.

                            {""} This gradient is typical in deep snowpacks that
                            commonly experience warm surface temperatures,

                            If a snowpack does not achieve that temperature
                            gradient, moisture will diffuse across different
                            parts of the snowpack, causing specific layers to
                            build weak, faceted snow grains. This behavior is
                            standard where the snowpack is shallow or
                            experiences exposure to frigid air temperatures, as

                      A colder storm in Steamboat, Colorado, drops 1.5 inches of
                      water as snow at 3% density, accumulating 50 inches of
                      fluffy powder.
                      <br />
                      The fallen snow in the Sierras, already quite dense, will
                      consolidate further into one solid layer a couple of feet
                      deep. The fluffy Colorado storm, on the other hand, will
                      likely consolidate to less than a foot of snow. Given the
                      shallower depth of the snow in Colorado and colder air
                      temperatures typically seen in that region's climate,
                      moisture will defuse out of the snowpack, forming faceted
                      grains beneath the surface.

                      Scenarios like the one described above explain why certain
                      regions, elevations, and aspects present different
                      conditions during snow travel. On the same day in April,
                      one hiker could traverse the entirety of the Bolam Glacier
                      on Mount Shasta's north flank, firmly staying atop the
                      snow, while another hiker could find themselves wading
                      thigh-deep on a north aspect in Colorado.

                      Freshly fallen snow and the density of old snow can
                      portray misleading data. When checking snow depth, it is
                      also valuable to examine the total SWE, as it offers
                      additional insight into the properties of the snowpack and
                      how it may evolve. This is also an excellent reason to
                      explore the data reports provided by remote weather
                      stations, which comprehensively examine the snowfall,
                      wind, and temperatures the snowpack experienced over time.
                      Once you understand a snowpack's metamorphic processes,
                      you can make informed predictions about how the snow has
                      transformed, given your observations.

                    <p>
                      Another complicating factor is that the colored overlays
                      showing snow depths are broad. While they reflect a
                      general overview of snow depth that you may encounter, the
                      actual depth, or existence of snow, can change depending
                      on the terrain. Furthermore, digital modeling of snow
                      cover does not address whether or not road access is
                      available. In cases where it is necessary to gather such
                      information, I resort to contacting gear shops, forest
                      service, and public works offices in nearby towns.

                      In some cases, searching social media and YouTube can be
                      another reliable way to assess conditions from afar. I
                      have found these platforms to be especially effective when
                      evaluating popular and commonly documented locations. For
                      example, on the day this article was published, a YouTube

                      uploaded listed three videos posted within the last month.
                      An Instagram search for #gannettpeak or check-ins at the
                      location returns many recent images, some with
                      descriptions detailing conditions on the route.

                      Say it's March 20, and you aim to section-hike the CDT
                      from Colorado's Wolf Creek to Slumgullion Pass during the
                      coming summer. Checking data over the past decade for June
                      20 reveals that, generally, the terrain you plan to cross
                      is clear of snow. However, observing SWE data on June 20,
                      2019, shows significantly more snow across the route that
                      year. Further examination reveals that 2019 experienced a
                      similar SWE on March 20 as your current year. While
                      weather leading to June could create more favorable
                      conditions, given what you've seen during a similar snow
                      season in 2019, it is probably best to plan your trip a
                      few weeks later.

                      This tool has also been invaluable in planning ski trips.
                      Over the years, I have learned that committing a trip plan
                      to specific location risks ending up in poor ski
                      conditions. Ever since a costly trip to Alaska in 2018
                      that resulted in poor skiing (but still a good bit of
                      fun), I keep my options open and my eyes on the NOHRSC to
                      ensure I end up skiing where snow is abundant and best in
                      quality. High amounts of SWE and overnight freezes
                      observed at weather stations in any given range are
                      usually positive indicators of good ski conditions.

                    Whether you plan to ski, hike, backpack, or predict what
                    watersheds may offer extended white-water seasons, these
                    tools can be valuable whenever you suspect snow may
                    influence your trip. As with all tools, these become more
                    useful as you practice using them and learn more about how
                    the data they collect impacts terrain. Spend time exploring
                    their interfaces and what they can provide to head into
                    trips more informed and, with any luck, more enjoyable
                    outcomes.
