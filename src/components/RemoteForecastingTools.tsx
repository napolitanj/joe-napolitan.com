                <p className="">
                  Snow cover is a key consideration when planning a winter
                  backpacking trip or a high-elevation hike in late spring or
                  early summer. Correct assessments can mean the difference
                  between a well-planned adventure and one that wastes time,
                  money, and energy. Fortunately, several free digital resources
                  can help you make informed decisions when planning routes
                  involving snow travel.

                  Understanding the basics of mountain snowpacks and how to
                  assess terrain remotely is crucial for extending your
                  backpacking season. This article provides tips and tools for
                  effective trip planning whenever snow is a factor, whether
                  you're setting off tomorrow or in the coming months.

                              Three distinct snow climates exist in mountainous
                              regions:

                                  <strong>Maritime snowpacks</strong> exist
                                  closer to oceans and experience heavier
                                  snowfall with comparatively warmer
                                  temperatures. These regions see storms that
                                  drop immense amounts of high-density snow with
                                  warm temperatures, leading to thick,
                                  consolidated snowpacks.

                              </li>

                                  <strong>Continental snowpacks</strong> are
                                  found in regions further from the ocean at
                                  high elevations and tend to see less
                                  precipitation than maritime climates. Storms
                                  in these regions are cold and tend to drop
                                  snow in lower volumes at lighter densities.
                                  Due to the characteristics of these storms,
                                  the resulting snowpack in these regions
                                  commonly presents layers of snow that vary in
                                  density and quality.

                                  two climates.

                              generalized assessments and that anomalies exist.
                              During winters when more or less snow may fall
                              than usual in any given area, mountains in a
                              continental climate may present conditions found
                              in a maritime environment and vice versa.

                              Snowpacks will evolve when exposed to gravity,
                              changes in temperature, and insulation from
                              continued snowfall. A temperature delta, referred
                              to as a <strong>temperature gradient</strong>,
                              exists where a snowpack consolidates and evolves
                              toward consistent density.
                            </p>
                            <p className="">
                              Generally,
                              <strong>
                                when a snowpack sees an average change in
                                temperature over at least 1 Â°C over a depth of
                                10cm, the snowpack will consolidate and round.
                              </strong>
                              This gradient is typical in deep snowpacks that
                              commonly experience warm surface temperatures,
                              conditions frequently seen in maritime regions.
                            </p>
                            <p className="">
                              If a snowpack does not achieve that temperature
                              gradient, moisture will diffuse across different
                              parts of the snowpack, causing specific layers to
                              build weak, faceted snow grains. This behavior is
                              standard where the snowpack is shallow or
                              experiences exposure to frigid air temperatures,
                              as is often found in continental climates during
                              winter.

                                        the transformed structure of snow grains

                                  Snow metamorphosis is complex, but that does
                                  not mean that more knowledge is not valuable.

                                  is a great resource for further exploration of
                                  these concepts. The critical takeaway is that
                                  different regions will present conditions that
                                  impact the quality of snow you will encounter.
                                  To illustrate this, imagine the following two
                                  scenarios:

                                  The fallen snow in the Sierras, already quite
                                  dense, will consolidate further into one solid
                                  layer a couple of feet deep. The fluffy
                                  Colorado storm, on the other hand, will likely
                                  consolidate to less than a foot of snow. Given
                                  the shallower depth of the snow in Colorado
                                  and colder air temperatures typically seen in
                                  that region's climate, moisture will defuse
                                  out of the snowpack, forming faceted grains
                                  beneath the surface.

                                  Scenarios like the one described above explain
                                  why certain regions, elevations, and aspects
                                  present different conditions during snow

                                  We'll keep things simple in this article, but
                                  it is important to note that you can click on
                                  "Create/Modify Report" at the top of your
                                  chart to observe data recorded in years past.
                                  This feature greatly expands the potential to
                                  observe trends and predict what conditions you
                                  may expect during any given week.

                                  is a tool that uses these remote weather
                                  stations and data collected via aircraft and
                                  satellites to represent snow data on a map
                                  visually. The interface includes many options
                                  for tweaking your map, but only a few are
                                  needed to inform your trip planning.

                                  click and drag on the map to focus on a
                                  region. By default, your drop-down for Select
                                  Physical Element will show SWE, but you can
                                  also change this to Snow Depth (among many
                                  other options). In the Select Date field, you
                                  can specify when in recorded history you would
                                  like to make your observation. You can then
                                  click âRedraw Mapâ to refresh the page with

                                  across North America and allows you to access

                                  compare current conditions with past years and
                                  create an informed forecast of what to expect
                                  in the coming months.

                                  checking snow depth, it is also valuable to
                                  examine the total SWE, as it offers additional
                                  insight into the properties of the snowpack
                                  and how it may evolve. This is also an
                                  excellent reason to explore the data reports
                                  provided by remote weather stations, which
                                  comprehensively examine the snowfall, wind,
                                  and temperatures the snowpack experienced over
                                  time. Once you understand a snowpack's
                                  metamorphic processes, you can make informed
                                  predictions about how the snow has
                                  transformed, given your observations.

                                  Another complicating factor is that the
                                  colored overlays showing snow depths are
                                  broad. While they reflect a general overview
                                  of snow depth that you may encounter, the
                                  actual depth, or existence of snow, can change
                                  depending on the terrain. Furthermore, digital
                                  modeling of snow cover does not address
                                  whether or not road access is available. In
                                  cases where it is necessary to gather such
                                  information, I resort to contacting gear
                                  shops, forest service, and public works
                                  offices in nearby towns.

                                  In some cases, searching social media and
                                  YouTube can be another reliable way to assess
                                  conditions from afar. I have found these
                                  platforms to be especially effective when
                                  evaluating popular and commonly documented
                                  locations. For example, on the day this
                                  article was published, a YouTube search for
                                  "Gannett Peak 2024" sorted by the most
                                  recently uploaded listed three videos posted
                                  within the last month. An Instagram search for
                                  #gannettpeak or check-ins at the location
                                  returns many recent images, some with
                                  descriptions detailing conditions on the
                                  route.

                                  Say it's March 20, and you aim to section-hike
                                  the CDT from Colorado's Wolf Creek to
                                  Slumgullion Pass during the coming summer.
                                  Checking data over the past decade for June 20
                                  reveals that, generally, the terrain you plan
                                  to cross is clear of snow. However, observing
                                  SWE data on June 20, 2019, shows significantly
                                  more snow across the route that year. Further
                                  examination reveals that 2019 experienced a
                                  similar SWE on March 20 as your current year.
                                  While weather leading to June could create
                                  more favorable conditions, given what you've
                                  seen during a similar snow season in 2019, it
                                  is probably best to plan your trip a few weeks
                                  later.

                                  This tool has also been invaluable in planning
                                  ski trips. Over the years, I have learned that
                                  committing a trip plan to specific location
                                  risks ending up in poor ski conditions. Ever
                                  since a costly trip to Alaska in 2018 that
                                  resulted in poor skiing (but still a good bit
                                  of fun), I keep my options open and my eyes on
                                  the NOHRSC to ensure I end up skiing where
                                  snow is abundant and best in quality. High
                                  amounts of SWE and overnight freezes observed
                                  at weather stations in any given range are
                                  usually positive indicators of good ski
