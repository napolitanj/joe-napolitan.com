            In 2018, I founded Origin Expeditions, a nonprofit focused on making
            wilderness education more accessible. I developed all external
            messaging, including the website copy, blog posts, trip
            communications, and fundraising updates â€” crafting a consistent and
            trusted voice for the organization. You can preview a introductions
            to some blogs post below, or view an archived snapshot of the
